# iOS

If you are using a phone that runs iOS, then I'm sad to announce, that you have hit upon the Nobihaza Player's Nightmare Operating System.

Support for Nobihaza games on iOS is still in its infancy and is in an experimental state. As of August 5, 2025, only **RPG Maker 2000/2003** games and some special **RPG Maker MV** games are supported on iOS.

Furthermore, as a closed operating system that is no different from a "prison", the method for installing third-party applications on iOS is also very complicated and prone to errors.

Read my explanation in the [FAQ](../faq#why-do-so-few-nobihaza-games-and-rpg-maker-games-in-general-run-on-ios) and you will understand.
