## Submit issues on GitHub

If you know how to use GitHub but don't want to code and just want to contribute error information, new bug fixes, or simply want to correct a mistake in my guide, you can:

* Create a [new Issue for nobihaza-guides on GitHub](https://github.com/Serena1432/nobihaza-guides/issues/new).

## Create a Pull Request on GitHub

This is for those who want to edit the code directly without needing me.

* [Fork the current nobihaza-guides project into your account](https://github.com/Serena1432/nobihaza-guides/fork).
* Feel free to edit the project (configuration files, design, or guide content) in your own way.
* When you are ready, [create a new Pull Request to request merging your code into the official website](https://github.com/Serena1432/nobihaza-guides/compare).
* Wait for me to accept the request, and it will be successful. You may also be asked for some information if I don't fully understand, so please always check your notifications and emails from GitHub.

## Message directly

Or, more simply, you can send a message to me, or any Administrator in the community!
