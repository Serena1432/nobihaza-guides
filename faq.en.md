# Frequently asked questions
{: .no_toc }

Below are the frequently asked questions, and I will try to answer as many as possible, as a Nobihaza game developer and the current developer of the **nbhzvn.one** website.

> This **Frequently Asked Questions** section only focuses on questions you would ask when **playing Nobihaza games** (or RPG Maker games in general), not on the definition of Nobihaza. Therefore, basic questions like "What is Nobihaza?" or "What year was the first Nobihaza game started?" will not be answered here.

## What engine are Nobihaza games made with?

All Nobihaza games are made with engines from the RPG Maker series, specifically from RPG Maker 2000 onwards.

## How can I identify which RPG Maker engine a Nobihaza game is made with?

You can read the guide on [how to identify RPG Maker games](./detect-rpg).

## What are the system requirements to play Nobihaza games?

Each game has a different level of complexity, so the system requirements for each game also differ. It's impossible to have a specific set of requirements for all games.

I just want to say: don't own a device that is too old, too cheap, or a low-spec device with too much background software installed, or one that "tries to keep up" by installing officially unsupported OS versions (like an Intel Celeron running Windows 11).

Otherwise, if your computer is well-optimized and doesn't have too much background software, I'm pretty sure your machine can play almost all Nobihaza games.

> These are the **minimum** requirements to run almost all Nobihaza games made on specific engines.

### RPG Maker 2000/2003

#### Computer

* **CPU:** 2 cores with 1 GHz clock speed or higher
* **RAM:** 512 MB or higher (or 1 GB if not using Windows)
* **GPU:** Any GPU that supports DirectX (or OpenGL if not using EasyRPG)
* **VRAM:** 128 MB or higher

#### Mobile Phone

* **OS:** Android 5.0 or iOS 11.0 or higher
* **CPU:** 4 cores with 1 GHz clock speed or higher
* **RAM:** 1 GB or higher

### RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace

#### Computer

* **CPU:** 2 cores with 1 GHz clock speed or higher
* **RAM:** 512 MB or higher (or 1 GB if not using Windows)
* **GPU:** Any GPU that supports DirectX 9.0 (or OpenGL/Vulkan if not using Windows)
* **VRAM:** 256 MB or higher

#### Mobile Phone

* **OS:** Android 8.0 or higher. iOS is not supported.
* **CPU:** 8 cores with 1 GHz clock speed or higher
* **RAM:** 2 GB or higher

### RPG Maker MV/MZ

These two engines in particular run on a web-based platform, not natively, so they will require significantly higher specs than the engines above. Also, since I'm familiar with these engines, I can provide more specific requirements.

#### Computer

* **CPU:** 2 cores, 2 threads with 2.5 GHz clock speed or higher, specifically Intel Pentium G2020 or AMD Athlon X4 740 or higher
* **RAM:** 4 GB or higher
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 or AMD Radeon R5 240 or higher
* **VRAM:** 1 GB or higher

#### Mobile Phone

* **OS:** Android 8.0 or higher, with the latest possible Android WebView version, and iOS 11.0 or higher
* **CPU:** Snapdragon 450/MediaTek MT6762/Kirin 659/Exynos 7870 or higher.
    * If you are using an iPhone/iPad, an iPhone 7/iPad 6th Gen or newer is required.
* **RAM:** 2 GB or higher

## Where can I download the games?

You can visit [the Chinese Nobihaza wiki](https://wiki.nobihazard.com/%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%8B%E8%BD%BD) for almost all collected links.

## Which Nobihaza game should I play first?

You should play the original **Nobihaza 1** by aaa-sensei, followed by **Nobihaza 2**, also by aaa-sensei, or **Nobihaza 2 MV Remake**; because these two games are the first ones that help you get familiar with the Nobihaza storyline.

After that, you can play any Nobihaza game, as the remaining ones are almost all unrelated to each other.

## I don't know how to install Nobihaza games.

Please select the operating system you are using and carefully read the instructions for that OS.

## I'm encountering error A, error B, error C while playing a Nobihaza game. How do I fix it?

Just like the question above, please select the operating system you are using and go to the **Troubleshooting and Tips** section.

## I can't play game X on operating system Y (which is not Windows)! What should I do?

Please ensure you have read and followed the instructions for your operating system.

However, if you have read them carefully and still cannot play, then unfortunately, the game you want to play is not compatible with your operating system, even with supporting software. At this point, the game developer is the only one who can help you.

## Why are Nobihaza games so laggy on macOS?

With the exception of EasyRPG, macOS is not well-optimized for Nobihaza game engines.

* RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace running through Wine is facing a serious issue where no version of DXVK supports DirectX 9, so Wine is forced to use its default translator with poorer performance, resulting in a laggier gaming experience.

* As for RPG Maker MV/MZ, it's simply based on NW.js with the Chromium engine, and Chromium is also not well-optimized for macOS, so playing games will be laggier than on Windows.

In short, all the problems are due to macOS not being well-optimized for gaming.

## Can I play Nobihaza on a game console?

Unfortunately, only EasyRPG (which runs RPG Maker 2000/2003 games) can be played on game consoles.

## Can I play Nobihaza with a controller?

If the game you want to play supports it.

## Why did you make a guide website instead of a video?

Guides can change in the future, and I can't re-upload a video every time there's an update.

Although a web-based guide might be more boring for some people, it is very easy to update without causing trouble later on.

## Why did you create guides for macOS and Linux?

Currently, many people have switched, or are intending to switch, to using macOS and Linux, and this guide might help those people play their favorite Nobihaza games on those operating systems.

Although only a small fraction of people use them, it doesn't mean no one does. This guide was created to support them as well.

## Why didn't you create a guide for game consoles?

Because I don't own any game consoles.

## I remember there are some softwares that support running Windows applications on Android, so why don't I see a guide for it here?

That type of software is very difficult to install, and I personally have no experience using it. Additionally, not all devices can run such software, so I will not provide a guide for it here.

Besides, most games nowadays already support Android. You should only look into this method if the game you want to play cannot be played using other methods.

## Can I use this guide to play other RPG Maker games that are not Nobihaza?

Absolutely, as long as those games were developed with RPG Maker.

## I want to make a Nobihaza game! Can you make a guide for it?

Google will be your trustworthy friend. I don't have experience with any engine other than RPG Maker MV, so I don't think I can make a guide.

## How long did it take you to make this guide?

I started making this guide on April 7, 2025. However, I also abandoned this project for nearly 2 months until I came back and finished this website.

## Should I use Scarlet like in your previous guide instead of ESign?

**NO!** I can no longer stand the tons of ads on that website. Even while I was making this guide and got to the Scarlet installation part, I couldn't close the website's ads, even after (accidentally) clicking on them.

## Is there a way to play RPG Maker MV/MZ games on iOS without having to build them myself?

Yes, but not right now. I am currently working on a separate launcher to run RPG Maker MV/MZ games on iOS, and its basic idea will be similar to JoiPlay on Android (but it won't support XP/VX/VX Ace, and of course, there will be some limitations).

Once I have more free time, I will start this project. The planned name for the launcher is **Verina**, and it will also be an open-source launcher uploaded to GitHub, just like other projects I have done before.

<details>
<summary><b>Why is this possible?</b></summary>
<br>
The nature of RPG Maker MV/MZ games is that they are developed on a web platform, and because it's a web platform, they can run on iOS without too much effort, just like I did with the Vietnamese version of Nobihaza 2 Remake.<br>
<br>
However, making a launcher means supporting all RPG Maker MV games, which includes a game selection menu, a virtual keyboard, freedom to change key layouts, save file management, etc.<br>
<br>
It's possible through the use of Cordova, which is a tool that allows web applications to interact with the system on iOS. So as long as I do enough research and have enough time, playing almost every RPG Maker MV title on iOS will be entirely possible.<br>
<br>
It will be much less exhausting than RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace, because those engines use Ruby. However, quite a few features still need to be added, so it will take a lot of time.
</details>

## Why do so few Nobihaza games (and RPG Maker games in general) run on iOS?

<details>
<summary><b>I have a lot to say about this particular topic.</b></summary>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>First and most importantly: iOS is very restrictive about allowing third-party app installations. To be officially released on iOS, you need a $99/year certificate to publish on the App Store (but I guarantee no Nobihaza game will ever get on there), and a $299/year certificate to distribute apps via the web without going through the App Store.<br>And if you're thinking about sideloading, my condolences, the higher the iOS version, the harder it is to sideload, and most methods require a computer.</li>
    <li>Even if you can sideload, the certificate will be revoked after 7 days and you must sideload it again.</li>
    <li>Apple requires a Mac to develop applications for iOS. There are actually some tools to help develop iOS apps on Windows, but they cannot be used to develop RPG Maker games.<br>And in the entire Vietnamese Nobihaza developer community, <b>I am the only one</b> who has a Mac, and it's not even a real Mac, it's a Hackintosh.</li>
    <li>After getting a Mac, you need an iPhone to be able to create a certificate and export the application to an <code>.ipa</code> file.</li>
    <li>iOS is very restrictive and doesn't freely allow files to be placed into an application's data directory.</li>
    <li>Specifically for RPG Maker MV/MZ games, developers are forced to use Safari's WebKit, which is <b>extremely laggy</b> and outdated, and to upgrade the WebKit version, what do we have to do? Upgrade the entire iOS, because the WebKit browser version is tied to the iOS version.</li>
</ul><br>
Before 2023, considering only Nobihaza games, only my <b>Doraemon: Nobita's Resident Evil 2 (Vietnamese)</b> supported iOS, and even that was unstable. It wasn't until November 2023, when I was the first in the Nobihaza community to announce EasyRPG for iOS, that Nobihaza games made with RPG Maker 2000/2003 could be played on iOS via RetroArch. Fortunately, the EasyRPG development team is planning to develop an official app for iOS, so playing EasyRPG games on iOS will be easier and more stable in the future.<br>
<br>
However, that's still just for RPG Maker 2000/2003. For RPG Maker VX/VX Ace, there is currently no way.

## When will RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace games be supported on iOS?

* Regarding the community outside of Nobihaza, some people are already testing RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace games on iOS, but it's not yet complete, and no game has been publicly announced as runnable on iOS. And even if there were, I'm not sure if it could play Nobihaza games.

* As for the Nobihaza community... it will probably be a long time. I currently lack both the experience and the time to research this issue. It's possible, but it will take a very long time, maybe even several years. By that time, someone from outside the community might finish it before me.
