## Downloading and Extracting

* First, download the game version for Android (labeled with the word Android or in `.apk` format). If there is no version for Android, download the game version for Windows.

* Open ZArchiver and tap on the newly downloaded file (usually in the `Download` folder).

* Enter the password for the compressed file if required. Wait for the extraction process to complete and continue.

## RPG Maker 2000/2003

You must use EasyRPG if you are playing games on a mobile phone.

* Move the newly extracted game folder into the **EasyRPG/games** folder of your phone's storage.

### Using JoiPlay

* Open the JoiPlay application, tap the plus sign in the top right corner and select **Add Game**.

* After it's added, the game will appear in the list. Tap on the game to start playing.
